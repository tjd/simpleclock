simpleclock is a hobby project that uses Java and the Processing library
to create a graphical analog clock. It started as a small project for
an introductory Java programming course, but quickly became more complex 
than most beginners can handle. Initially, it was written in a straightforward
procedural-style that Processing encourages, but it is natural to make it
more object-oriented.
