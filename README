simpleclock is a hobby project that uses Java and the Processing library
to create a graphical analog clock. It started as a small project for
an introductory Java programming course, but quickly became more complex 
than most beginners can handle. 

Initially, it was written in a straightforward procedural-style that 
Processing encourages, but it is natural to make it more object-oriented.
So a lot of the changes to this project are refactoring the code to make
it OO, and thus much more flexible.

The Processing library is in the file processing/code.jar: make
sure to add it as an exernal archive to your project's build path in
Eclipse.
